So here I go...<br>
Baby I lo-o-o-ve you<br>

Never got this close to anyone, cause I was always afraid and it's not good now<br>
But now i know, that I'll fall right in-to your arms...<br>
Don't ever let me go<br>

I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight<br>
I want your arms around me & I, want your lips on mine<br>
I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified<br>
My hands are shaking, my heart is racing<br>
Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny<br>
So here I go...<br>
Baby I lo-o-o-ve you<br>

What is there , is just saanjh<br>

I want your arms around me & I, want your lips on mine<br>
I wanna say I love you, but, babe I'm terrified<br>
My hands are shaking, my heart is racing<br>
Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny<br>
So here I go...<br>
